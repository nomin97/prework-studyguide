# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
The motivation to create this study guide was to be able to look at it and refer to it throughout the bootcamp. This is my first project so I wanted to explore the different aspects of creating a webpage, such as html, css, JavaScript, and now the README.md guide. I built this project as a way to practice the skills we are starting to learn in class. For future and current bootcamp students, they will be able to look at this study guide and use it to help them as they go through class. In addition to using html, css, and JavaScript, I have also learned how to use Github for version control, pulling and pushing changes, commits, cloning repositories, and also using the command line/terminal.

## Usage
This study guide has a couple of notes regarding the four sections for creating webpages; HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. Users can also use the inspect tool to open the DevTools console and explore the webpage's elements to see what the HTML code, CSS code, and console looks like. There are many elements, like heading, margin, display, and coloring that can be explored through opening the DevTools console.
